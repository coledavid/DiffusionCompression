This repo contains my work on a diffusion compression project where I upscaled 32x32 images to 128x128 resolution.

The results of this were very promising and a link to a thorough analysis will be added here when available. 

To view the code I sepearted it into two seperate .ipynb files

The first is the diffusion methods where the diffusion model was created following this tutorial: https://medium.com/@adityanutakki6250/sr3-explained-and-implemented-in-pytorch-from-scratch-b43b9742c232

The second is all of my image compression techniques and and comparison metrics.

These comparison and compression techniques are also seperated into a seperate folder and documented based on purpose.

Any questions can be directed to davidsonchristian@outlook.com
